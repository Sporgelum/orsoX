#### 10Xv2 single cell RNA seq analysis using the following tools:
* Kallisto for: 
   + Indexing . 
   + Pseudomapping.
* BUStools for: 
   + Correct.  
   + Sort.  
   + Count.  
* RStudio for:
   + transforming SYMBOLS → ENTREZgeneID. 
   + Over Representation Analysis (ORA) annotation of the genes for each cluster.  

Find the jupyter notebooks for the analysis steps followed with Kallisto and ScanPy, divided in two steps:
   * 1st, getting ready up to the gene matrix, using the first part of the pipeline. (pipeKJBUSsingleCell10x.ipynb)
      
   * 2nd, analysis of the data using ScanPy and RStudio scripts, for annotating the data.
         For experimental condition → ExperimentalLeiden
         For control condition → ControlLeiden 
         For the enrichment of the clusters use the following R scripts:
           Control                  →           v3_clusterAnnotation_controlPath.R
           Experimental             →           v3_clusterAnnotation_experimentalPath.R
