#### 10Xv2 single cell RNA seq analysis using the following tools:
* Kallisto for: 
   + Indexing . 
   + Pseudomapping.
* BUStools for: 
   + Correct.  
   + Sort.  
   + Count.  
* RStudio for:
   + transforming SYMBOLS → ENTREZgeneID. 
   + Over Representation Analysis (ORA) annotation of the genes for each cluster.  

Find the jupyter notebooks for the analysis steps followed with Kallisto and ScanPy, divided in two steps:
   * 1st, getting ready up to the gene matrix.
   * 2nd, analysis of the data using ScanPy and RStudio scripts, for annotating the data.
